<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This document contains a description of the MyMyUNSW database
as an annotated ER model.
Note that some parts of the model are grey-ed out; the tables implied
by these ER elements are not populated in the database, because they are
not relevant to this assignment.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
UNSW handles its administrative information using a version of the
Peoplesoft product called Campus Solutions.
This system is normally accessed via the MyUNSW portal and is
maintained by the NSS unit in UNSW IT, and so it's variously
called <q>PeopleSoft</q>, <q>Campus Solutions</q>, <q>MyUNSW</q>
and <q>NSS</q>.
The database behind the system is hosted on a large Oracle server,
and throughout this document will be referred to as the <q>NSS
database</q>.
<p>
The PeopleSoft system was installed in 2000 and has been modified/extended
over the years to encompass:
</p>
<ul>
<li> human resources (staff/employees, payroll, etc.)
<li> financials (purchases, income/expenditure, etc.)
<li> academic (students, courses, classes, enrolment, etc.)
</ul>
<!--
<p>
It is in the process of being upgraded to the latest version of
Campus Solutions (CS9).
</p>
-->
<p>
The current NSS database is separate from the UNSW Handbook,
which records all of the official information related to course
and program/degree requirements.
To support on-line enrolment, NSS does represent some course
information, such as pre-requisites, co-requisites and exclusions,
as well as enrolment quotas.
However, it maintains this information independently to the Handbook,
which leads to potential inconsistency.
Worse, NSS maintains no information at all about program/degree
requirements, which means that students cannot use NSS to monitor
their progress through their degree.
</p>
<p>
The MyMyUNSW database aims to implement a superset of the contents
of the NSS database, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li> people: staff, students
<li> infrastructure: buildings, rooms, facilities
<li> organisation: faculties, schools, centres
<li> academic: programs, streams, subjects, courses, classes
</ul>
<p>
Note: there are two places in this schema where we deviate from
current UNSW terminology. A <b>stream</b> is a new term that
refers to what the current UNSW Handbook calls a <q>plan</q>
or <q>specialisation</q>.
Streams also encompass the collections of courses that comprise
<q>majors</q> and <q>minors</q> in many degrees.
Also, in our schema, we use the terms <b>subject</b> and
<b>course</b> to talk about a unit of study (subject) and a
particular offering of a subject in a given semester (course).
UNSW confusingly calls both of these a <q>course</q>, although
it also sometimes also uses the term <q>course offering</q>
for the second.
<p>
The academic information includes subject pre/co-requisites and
program/degree requirements, as well as all of the descriptive
material from the UNSW handbook.
This assemblage of information means that the MyMyUNSW database
can be used as a basis for:
</p>
<ul>
<li> on-line course and class enrolments
<li> managing room allocation and time-tabling
<li> monitoring progress through programs
<li> producing the UNSW Handbook
</ul>
<p>
Only the first, and part of the second, of these are provided
by the current PeopleSoft system.
</p>

<h3>Data Model and Schema</h3>
<p>
This section aims to give an overview of the data model.
It concentrates mainly on the entities and their relationships.
The details of attributes are provided in the
<a href="schema.sql">SQL schema</a>.
</p>
<p>
Some considerations in the development of our data model:
<ul>
<li> there are two main kinds of <b>people</b> in the system: staff
	and students; all people have certain basic information
	associated with them (e.g. name); staff have additional
	information related to their employment; students have
	additional information related to the degree that they
	are studying; there are also people who are neither staff
	nor students that UNSW wants to record (e.g. members of
	the University Council)
<li> UNSW runs a number of teaching <b>terms</b> each year
	(these are also called <q>sessions</q> or <q>semesters</q>)
<li> a <b>subject</b> is a unit of study in a particular area
	(e.g. introductory programming, database systems, etc.);
	a subject is defined primarily by its syllabus
<li> a <b>course</b> is a particular offering of a subject in
	a particular teaching term; it has a course convener
	(also called lecturer-in-charge), perhaps an enrolment
	quota, and is associated with a number of classes
<li> a <b>class</b> is a teaching activity at a scheduled time
	in a scheduled place; examples of classes are lectures,
	tutorials and labs; a class is associated with a course
<li> a <b>degree</b> is an award given to a student who completes
	a specified program of study
<li> a <b>program</b> is a named program of study leading to
	one or more degrees
<li> a <b>stream</b> specifies the precise requirements for study
	in a specific area; it is used to implement the notions of
	<i>major</i> and <i>minor</i>
<li> in a particular program, students choose at least one stream
	from a range of possible streams (in a double degree, they
	will choose two streams, one from each set of streams for
	the constituent degrees); the program will specify precisely
	what are the allowed/required combinations of streams
<li> to satisfy the requirements of the program, a student must
	satisfy the requirements of all the streams that they
	enrol in from the program; in addition, there may be
	requirements from the program itself (e.g. general
	education, total units of credit completed, etc.)
<li> there are several different types of requirements:
<ul>
<li> subject requirements (core subject, electives, limitations)
<li> stream requirements (e.g. must take one from the BCom majors)
<li> program requirements (e.g. must be enrolled in 3648 to take SENG1010)
<li> UOC requirements (e.g. overall plan needs at least 144 UC)
<li> WAM requirements (e.g. must have WAM of at least 65 for Hons)
<li> stage requirements (e.g. must be in stage 2 of program to take COMP2 courses)
<li> stream requirements (e.g. complete one major from a set of majors)
<li> miscellaneous requirements (e.g. industrial training)
</ul>
<li> in specifying requirements, we frequently need to deal with sets
	of academic objects (either programs or streams or subjects);
	we call these (generically) <b>academic groupings</b>
<li> we use <b>subject groups</b> in specifying subject requirements;
	each subject group has a name (e.g. "level 3/4 COMP courses")
	and an associated set of subjects
<li> similarly for <b>stream groups</b> (e.g. "set of BA majors") and
	<b>program groups</b> (e.g. "all programs offered by CSE")
<li> a <b>subject requirement</b> specifies: a subject group, a number of
	UOC associated with the group, whether this number is a minimum
	or maximum requirement; this is flexible enough to allow us to
	describe:
	<ul>
	<li> core requirements (group size 1, must complete 1 course from the group)
	<li> alternatives (several related courses, must complete 1 of them)
	<li> professional electives (set of courses from one area, must complete <i>k</i> of them)
	<li> limitations (e.g. no more than 72 UC of level 1 courses)
	</ul>
<li> in terms of the ideas above, programs and streams are defined as
	collections of requirements; a particular student must satisfy
	all of the requirements before they are regarded as having
	completed the program or stream
<li> how to determine whether a student has satisfied requirements
	depends on the type of requirement:
	<ul>
	<li> for UOC, use the course enrolment information
	<li> for course requirements, use the course enrolment information
	<li> for miscellaneous, must explicitly record that the student has met them<br>
		(because there's no other data that will allow us to work it out)
	</ul>
<li> at any given time, each student is <b>enrolled</b> in one program, one or
	more streams (associated with the program), and generally several
	courses and classes within those courses; we need to record all four
	kinds of enrolment
<li> for enrolment in a program, it is useful to know when the student's
	enrolment commenced, when it ended (if it has ended), and their
	current status (e.g. active, on leave, etc.)
<li> over their lifetime, students may enrol in several programs,
	each with associated streams and courses
<li> a <b>schedule</b> describes when in a stream particular courses should
	be taken; in our terms, it will relate subject groups to streams and
	associate specific (year,semester) combinations with them
<li> sometimes, we wish to allow a student to <b>vary</b> from the standard
	requirements of their degree plans;
	there are three types of substitutions:
	<ul>
	<li> substitution: replace one course by another within a program
	<li> advanced standing: get credit for a course from elsewhere (or
		from a partly-completed UNSW degree) to
		use in place of some course in a program
	<li> exemption: get recognition for having studied a course
		elsewhere so that this can be used as a pre-requisite
		for further study at UNSW
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Treat the ER data model description below as an overview,
and consult the <a href="schema.sql">SQL Schema</a> for full details
on how the database is implemented.
The ER diagrams below make a number of simplifications to the complete
SQL schema: many attributes are omitted, some names are changed (e.g.
entity names are singular here, but plural in the SQL schema).
</p>
<p>
To make the presentation clearer, the data model is presented in a
number of sections.
</p>

<h3 class="entity">People/Courses/Terms</h3>
<p>Entities and relationships related to students/staff/courses/terms ...</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="Pic/mymyunsw/person+course.png">
</div>
Comments:
<ul>
<li> the Person entity would clearly have much additional data associated
	with it in a real implementation (contact details, etc.)
<li> note that the use of <tt>Subjects.id</tt> rather than <tt>Subjects.code</tt>
	as a primary key actually allows us to implement multiple versions
	of a given subject; we also need to know the period over which the
	particular version is relevant, and this is recorded in the subject
	record
<li> in reality, a course offering has a lot of other information
	associated with it (e.g. enrolment quotas, assessment schemes,
	classes); some of these appear in the database, some don't
<li> the <i>n:m</i> relationship allows multiple staff to be associated with
	the teaching of a given course offering; one of these staff is
	required to be a course convener (this could have been implemented
	via an extra field in the <tt>Courses</tt> table to force the above
	constraint, but since it's also a Role, we decided to implement it
	as such and do the constraint via a trigger)
</ul>


<h3 class="entity">Programs/Streams/Degrees</h3>
<p>Entities related to programs/streams/degrees ...</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="Pic/mymyunsw/academic-objects.png">
</div>
<p>... and relationships between them ...</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="Pic/mymyunsw/prog+stream-relns.png">
</div>
Comments:
<ul>
<li> here, we show minimal attributes for the Program, Degree and Stream entities;
	see the schema for full details
<li> a program leads to one or more degrees (e.g. BSc, BE/BCom)
<li> a degree occurs in at least one program (e.g. straight BE, BE/BCom, BE/BSc)
<li> streams may be used in several programs (e.g. BE component of combined degrees)
<li> specific requirements may also be used in several plans
</ul>

<h3 class="entity">Requirements</h3>
<p>Entities and relationships related to requirements ...</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="Pic/mymyunsw/requirements.png">
</div>
Comments:
<ul>
<li> every requirement is either a
<ul>
<li> <em>UOC</em> ... student must meet minimum/maximum UOC limits
<li> <em>stage</em> ... student must be in specified stage of program
<li> <em>WAM</em> ... student must meet minimum/maximum WAM limits
<li> <em>inProgram</em> ... student is currently enrolled in one of a set of programs
<li> <em>inStream</em> ... student is currently enrolled in one of a set of streams
<li> <em>inSubject</em> ... student is currently enrolled in one of a set of subjects
<li> <em>doneProgram</em> ... student has completed requirements of program(s)
<li> <em>doneStream</em> ... student has completed requirements of stream(s)
<li> <em>doneSubject</em> ... student has successfully completed subject(s) 
<li> <em>compound</em> ... combines other requirements via boolean operator
<li> <em>miscellaneous</em> ... other non-computable requirement (e.g. industrial training)
</ul>
<li> many of the requirement types refer to a set of academic objects
	(e.g. set of subjects in an elective group); such sets are
	represented by the <tt>AcadObjectGroups</tt> table
<li> a requirement can be negated via a flag in the requirement record
<li> requirements may specify minimum and maximum values (see examples above)
<li> using min, max and academic object sets allows you express requirements like
<ul>
<li> must complete between 24 and 36 UOC from COMP3* courses (subject group)
<li> must complete one major from the BA majors (stream group)
<li> must be enrolled in a CSE degree (program group)
</ul>
<li> if a requirement is really a logical combination of other requirements,
	it can be expressed as a compound requirement; a compound requirement
	combines a set of requirements via logical AND or logical OR;
	compound requirements can be nested
<li> note that the sets of requirements for Programs, Streams amd Subject
	pre-requisites are implicitly conjunctive (i.e. you need to satisfy
	all of them before you have completed the Program or Stream or met
	the pre-requisite requirement for the Subject)
<li> miscellaneous requirements pick up all of the other non-course-related
	requirements that exist in various degrees (e.g. industrial training
	for Engineers); since there are no enrolments records or other kinds
	of records to check that these were completed, we need an explicit
	link between the student and the requirement to indicate this
</ul>

<h3 class="entity">Academic Object Groups</h3>
<p>Groups of academic objects that are central to the definition of requirements ...</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="Pic/mymyunsw/academic-object-groups.png">
</div>
<br/>
<ul>
<li> an academic object group (<i>AcObjGroup</i>) specifies a set of
	academic objects of one type (e.g. a set of streams,
	set of courses, etc.)
<li> each <i>AcObjGroup</i> has a name which describes its purpose and is
	used for looking up groups when programs and streams are
	being defined
<li> the members of an <i>AcObjGroup</i> may be defined in three ways:
<ul>
<li> by enumeration (explicitly noting each member of the group)
<li> by giving patterns to identify the members (e.g. <tt>COMP3###</tt>)
<li> by giving an SQL query to lookup the members and return a set of IDs
</ul>
<li> in the case of a set of requirements, you can also specify the logic
	of how the members are defined (conjunction or disjunction)
</ul>
<p>
Note: in these patterns, a '#' is like a '_' in an SQL <tt>like</tt> pattern
or a '.' in a regular expression pattern.
</p>
<p>
Both <tt>enumerated</tt> and <tt>pattern</tt> groups are defined using
a definition which is comma-separated list of items. The difference is
that <tt>pattern</tt> groups may have items like <tt>COMP3###</tt>, which
matches any course with a code starting with "<tt>COMP3</tt>", while an
<tt>enumerated</tt> group is simply a list of course or stream codes.
One exception is that alternatives may be specified in an enumerated
list as <tt>{MATH1131;MATH1141}</tt>; this means that a student can
take either MATH1131 or MATH1141 to satisfy the group requirements.
</p>

<h3 class="entity">Enrolment</h3>
<p>Relationships for various kinds of enrolment ...</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="Pic/mymyunsw/enrolments.png">
</div>
Comments:
<ul>
<li> students initially start at UNSW by enrolling in a program
<li> once enrolled, they choose a specific stream (or streams) to study
	within that program
<li> this requires them to enrol in courses, and they generally enrol in
	one or more classes in the course (note that NSS uses enrolment
	in the lecture class as the way of indicating that a student is
	enrolled in a course; our schema does not do this)
<li> all these notions of <q>enrolment</q> have different kinds of information
	associated with them
<li> we have used total participation for Students-EnrollIn-Program
	to indicate that they must be enrolled in at least one program;
	it's an n:m relationship because, over time, they may enrol in
	other programs (e.g. complete their undergraduate degree and
	then later do a coursework masters degree)
<li> note that the mark alone is not sufficient to determine whether
	a student has successfully completed a course; they need a
	passing grade to ensure this (the set of grades indicating a
	pass includes SY, PC, PS, CR, DN, HD ... there is also a PT
	grade which is no longer used but is included to allow us to
	deal with old data)
</ul>

<h3 class="entity">Variations</h3>
<p><b>Note</b>: for this assignment we will be ignoring variations.
We include their schema for the sake of completeness.
</p>
<p>Variations of meeting requirements within programs ...</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="Pic/mymyunsw/variations.png">
</div>
Comments:
<ul>
<li> the purpose of a variation is to indicate that a student has
	effectively completed one course at UNSW, without necessarily
	having enrolled in and passed that course
<li> there are three kinds of variation: substitution, advanced standing,
	exemption
<li> a substitution might be used to replace a core course in a plan
	by some other course if the core course is not available
<li> advanced standing gives credit towards a degree, based on study towards
	a different degree either at UNSW or elsewhere (typically, advanced
	standing is only granted when the degree containing the
	course was not completed)
<li> including courses from other institutions means that we need a
	representation for them; we have used a very simple representation
<li> finally, exemptions allow us to record that a student has some
	specific background knowledge (to use as a pre-requisite for
	some other course); an exemption does not confer credit
	towards a degree, however
</ul>

<h3 class="entity">Organisational Units</h3>
<p><b>Note</b>: for this assignment, we are largely ignoring
organisational units, except as owners of subjects.
</p>
<p>Units (e.g. Faculties, Schools, Departments) within UNSW ...</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="Pic/mymyunsw/orgunits.png">
</div>
Comments:
<ul>
<li> units are nested (e.g. the CSE school is in the Engineering Faculty which
is within UNSW)
<li> this nesting is handled via a <tt>UnitGroups</tt> table
<li> there is a meta-orgunit <tt>UNSW</tt> which all of the faculties are
members of
<li> since we don't have staff in the database, there's no need for affiliations
<li> the n:m relationship between staf:roles:orgunits means that a staff member
could be affiliated with several orgiunits or could have multiple roles within
a single orgunit
</ul>

<h3 class="entity">Rooms and Buildings</h3>
<p><b>Note</b>: for this assignment we will be ignoring rooms
and buildings.
We include their schema for the sake of completeness.
</p>
<p>Places to hold classes, offices, etc.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="Pic/mymyunsw/rooms+buildings.png">
</div>

<h3>SQL Schema</h3>
<p>
We have developed an <a href="schema.sql">SQL schema</a>
based on the above data model.
With the above background, you are now in a good position
to examine this schema, keeping in mind that the schema does
not follow precisely what has been specified above in all cases.
</p>

<h3>Database Contents</h3>
<p>
The student/course/enrolment part of the database has been populated
using real data which was transformed to make it anonymous
(i.e. names, marks, enrolments changed to protect the innocent).
The subject/program part of the database was populated from
enrolment data.
The requirements part will be populated from data in the
ECLIPS database and the Handbook.
The class data would have been populated using data from the UNSW
timetable site, if we were including classes.
</p>
<p>
For this assignment,
we have decided to focus on students enrolled in degrees offered by
CSE (e.g. Computer Science, Software Engineering),
and so only rules relevant to these degrees are included,
and only enrolments by CSE students are included.
</p>
<p>
Note that the task of populating such a large database is extremely
time-consuming and so many parts of the database are unpopulated or
populated only very <q>thinly</q>.
Some parts have data that is close to reality, while others have data
that is a pale shadow of reality.
In order to get a feeling for what is actually present, you must spend
some time exploring the database when it is eventually populated.
