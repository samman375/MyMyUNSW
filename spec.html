There is enough information in this draft for you to start planning
how you will extract the data and prepare it for output.
Precise details of the output formats will be available when the
Examples and Testing pages are populated.
The Rules and Academic_object_groups tables are not yet populated,

<h3>Aims</h3>
<p>
This assignment aims to give you practice in
</p>
<ul>
<li> reading and understanding a moderately large and complex  relational schema (MyMyUNSW)
<li> implementing Python scripts to extract and display data from a database based on this schema
<li> implementing SQL views and PLpgSQL functions to aid in satisfying requests for information
</ul>
<p>
The goal is to build some useful data access operations on the MyMyUNSW database. 
</p>
<p>
A minor theme of this assignment is "dirty data". We built the
database, using a collection of reports from UNSW's information
systems.
There may be a very occasional glitch in the data,
but the data is not generally dirty. Just work whatâ€™s given,
and if it produces strange results, then write some queries
to check whether those results fit with what's actually in
the database, which is something you should be doing anyway.
</p>
<p>
You may bump into some residual data issues as you
try to solve the problems below.
Let us know via the Forum if you have found such data anomalies.
</p>

<h4>How to do this assignment:</h4>
</p>
<ul>
<li> read this specification carefully and completely
<li> familiarise yourself with the <a href="database.php">database schema</a>
<li> create a database <tt>mymyunsw</tt> on the host <tt>d.cse</tt>
<li> explore the database to see how rules, etc. are represented
<li> make a private directory for this assignment
<li> put a copy of the template files there
<li> edit the files in this directory on a host other than <tt>d.cse</tt>
<li> on <tt>d.cse</tt>, test that your Python scripts produce the expected output
<li> submit the assignment via WebCMS3 or <tt>give</tt>
	(as described on the <a href="submitting.php">What to Submit</a> page)
</ul>
<p>
And, of course, if you have PostgreSQL installed on your home machine,
you can do all of the <tt>d.cse</tt> work there. BUT don't forget to
test it on <tt>d.cse</tt> before submitting.
</p>
<p>
The "template files" aim to save you some time in writing Python code.
E.g. they handle the command-line arguments and let you focus on the
database interaction. They are available in a file
<a href="files/ass2.zip">ass2.zip</a>, which contains the following
</p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>helpers.sql</tt> ... any views or PLpgSQL functions to assist your Python </li>
<li> <tt>helpers.py</tt> ... any Python function to share between scripts </li>
<li> <tt>trans</tt> ... Python script to produce a transcript </li>
<li> <tt>rules</tt> ... Python script to display program/stream rules</li>
<li> <tt>prog</tt> ... Python script to do progression check </li>
</ul>
<p>
There are even a couple of functions in <tt>helpers.py</tt>. Freebies!
</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
All Universities require a significant information infrastructure in order
to manage their affairs. This typically involves a large commercial DBMS
installation.
UNSW's student information system sits behind the MyUNSW web site.
MyUNSW provides an interface to a PeopleSoft enterprise management
system with an underlying Oracle database. This back-end system
(Peoplesoft/Oracle) is sometimes called NSS. The specific version of
PeopleSoft that we use is called Campus Solutions. There is also a
system called SiMS, which can be used to access the data.
</p>
<p>
UNSW has spent a considerable amount of money ($100M+) on the MyUNSW/NSS
system, and it handles much of the educational administration plausibly
well. Most people gripe about the quality of the MyUNSW interface, but
the system does allow you to carry out most basic enrolment tasks online.
</p>
<p>
Despite its successes, however, MyUNSW/NSS still has a number of
deficiencies, including:
<ul>
<li> no usable representation for degree program structures
<li> minimal integration with the UNSW Online Handbook
</ul>
<p>
The first point prevents MyUNSW/NSS from being used for three
important operations that would be extremely helpful to students
in managing their enrolment:
</p>
<ul>
<li> finding out how far they have progressed through their degree
	program, and what remains to be completed
<li> checking what are their enrolment options for next semester
	(e.g.,  get a list of <q>suggested</q> courses)
<li> determining when they have completed all of the requirements
	of their degree program and are eligible to graduate
</ul>
<p>
The second point allows for inconsistencies between the Handbook
and the system that manages enrolment.
</p>
<p>
NSS contains data about students, courses, classes, pre-requisites,
quotas, etc. but does not contain any representation of UNSW's
degree program structures.
Without such information in the NSS database, it is not possible
to do any of the above three.
So, in 2007 the COMP3311 class devised a data model that
could represent program requirements and rules for UNSW degrees.
This was built on top of an existing schema that represented all
of the core NSS data (students, staff, courses, classes, etc.).
The enhanced data model was named the <q>MyMyUNSW</q> schema.
</p>
<p>
The MyMyUNSW database includes information that encompasses the
functionality of NSS, the UNSW Online Handbook, and the CATS
(room allocation) database.
The MyMyUNSW data model, schema and database are
described in a <a href="schema.php">separate document</a>.
Note that, while the <em>schema</em> is the complete one we developed
in 2007, the <em>data</em> for this database has been trimmed to the
absolute minimum to do this assignment; many tables and
columns are empty.
</p>

<h3>Setting Up</h3>

<p>
To install the MyMyUNSW database under your PostgreSQL server on <tt>d.cse</tt>,
simply run the following two commands (after ensuring that your server
is running):
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>createdb mymyunsw</b>
$ <b>psql mymyunsw -f /home/cs3311/web/21T3/assignments/ass2/mymyunsw.dump</b>
</pre>
<p>
If everything proceeds correctly, the load output should look
something like:
</p>
<pre>
SET
SET
...
SET
CREATE DOMAIN
<span class='comment'>... a few of these</span>
CREATE TABLE
<span class='comment'>... a whole bunch of these</span>
COPY <i>n</i>
<span class='comment'>... a whole bunch of these</span>
ALTER TABLE
<span class='comment'>... a whole bunch of these</span>
ALTER TABLE
</pre>
<p>
You should get no <tt>ERROR</tt> messages.
The database loading should take less than 10 seconds on <tt>d.cse</tt>, assuming
that <tt>d.cse</tt> is not under heavy load.
(If you leave your assignment until the last minute, loading the database
on <tt>d.cse</tt> may be considerably slower, thus delaying your work even more.
The solution: at least load the database <em>Right Now</em>, even if you
don't start using it for a while.)
(Note that the <tt>mymyunsw.dump</tt> file is 3MB in size; copying it under
your home directory on the CSE machines is not a good idea.)
</p>
<p>
Note that the database is called <tt>mymyunsw</tt> (when you want to access
it via <tt>psql</tt> or Python script).
Throughout this document we refer to the database as "MyMyUNSW".
Note also that this is <b>not</b> real data, although it was generated
with much swizzling, from real data.
</p>
<p>
A useful thing to do initially is to get a feeling for what data is
actually there. This may help you understand the schema better, and
will make the descriptions of the exercises easier to understand.
Look at the schema. Ask some queries. Do it now.
</p>
<p>
Examples ...
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>psql mymyunsw</b>
<span class="comment">... PostgreSQL welcome stuff ...</span>
mymyunsw=# <b>\d</b>
<span class="comment">... look at the schema ...</span>
mymyunsw=# <b>select * from Students;</b>
<span class="comment">... look at the Students table; a list of zid's ...</span>
mymyunsw=# <b>select p.id,p.fullname from People p join Students s on p.id=s.id;</b>
<span class="comment">... look at the names and UNSW ids of all students ...</span>
mymyunsw=# <b>select p.id,p.fullname,s.phone from People p join Staff s on p.id=s.id;</b>
<span class="comment">... only one result because there's only one staff ...</span>
mymyunsw=# <b>select count(*) from Course_enrolments;</b>
<span class="comment">... how many course enrolment records ...</span>
mymyunsw=# <b>select * from dbpop();</b>
<span class="comment">... how many records in all tables ...</span>
mymyunsw=# <span class="comment">... etc. etc. etc.</span>
mymyunsw=# <b>\q</b>
</pre>
<p>
You will find that many tables (e.g. <tt>Books</tt>, <tt>Buildings</tt>,
etc.) are currently unpopulated; their contents are not needed for this
assignment.
</p>

<h4>Summary on Getting Started</h4>

To set up your database for this assignment, run the following commands:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>ssh <tt>d.cse</tt></b>
<span class="comment">... and then on <tt>d.cse</tt> ...</span>
$ <b>source /localhost/$USER/env</b>
$ <b>p1</b>
<span class="comment">... you shut down the server after your last session, didn't you?</span>
$ <b>createdb  mymyunsw</b>
$ <b>psql  mymyunsw  -f  /home/cs3311/web/21T3/assignments/ass2/mymyunsw.dump</b>
$ <b>psql  mymyunsw</b>
<span class="comment">... run some checks to make sure the database is ok</span>
$ <b>mkdir  <i>Assignment2Directory</i></b>
<span class="comment">... make a working directory for Assignment 2</span>
$ <b>cd <i>Assignment2Directory</i></b>
$ <b>unzip /home/cs3311/web/21T3/assignments/ass2/files/ass2.zip</b>
<span class="comment">... puts the template files in your working directory</span>
</pre>
<p>
The only messages produced by these commands should be those noted above.
If you omit any of the steps, then things will not work as planned.
If you subsequently ask questions on the Forums, where it's
clear that you have <em>not</em> done and checked the above steps,
the questions will not be answered.
</p>

<h3>Exercises</h3>

<h3>Q1 <span class='marks'>(6 marks)</span></h3>

<p>
Write a Python script called <tt>trans</tt>, that takes
a command-line argument giving a student ID, and prints
a transcript for that student.
The template script already checks the command line argument.
<p>
Each line of the transcript should contain
</p>
<pre>
CourseCode  Term  SubjectTitle  Mark  Grade  UOC
</pre>
<p class='brown'>
Use the following f-string to get the formatting right
</p>
<pre class='red'>
f"{CourseCode} {Term} {SubjectTitle:<32s}{Mark:>3} {Grade:>2s}  {UOC:2d}uoc"
</pre>
<p>
Entries should be ordered by term, and within the same term, by course code.
You should also calculate a WAM and display this at the end of the course
lines.
The WAM is given by </nobr><i>WAM = Sum(Mark*UOC) / TotalAttemptedUOC</i></nobr>.
How to use the grades and marks to determine the WAM is given
in the <a href="grades+rules.php">Grades + Rules</a>  page.
The precise format of the output will be available in the
<a href="examples.php">Examples</a> page.
</p>
<p class="red">
Ii either of the mark or grad is null, print a "-",
right-aligned, where grade or mark would normally go.
</p>
<p>
To simplify this task, it would be useful to write a
<tt>transcript(integer)</tt> function to extract transcript
data in the correct order as a sequence of tuples of type
<tt>TranscriptRecord</tt>.
This type is already defined in the database and you can
use it or not as you see fit.
</p>
<p>
Tuples of type <tt>TranscriptRecord</tt> contain:
</p>
<pre>
create type TranscriptRecord as (
        code  char(8), -- UNSW-style course code (e.g. COMP1021)
        term  char(4), -- term code (e.g. 18s2, 20T3)
        name  text,    -- short name of the course's subject
        mark  integer, -- numeric mark acheived
        grade char(2), -- grade code (e.g. FL,UF,PS,CR,DN,HD)
        uoc   integer  -- units of credit awarded for the course
);
</pre>
<p>
Note that this type is already in the database so you won't need
to define it if you wish to use it.
</p>

<h3>Q2 <span class='marks'>(6 marks)</span></h3>

<p>
Write a Python script that takes a program code or a stream code
and produces a readable list of rules for that program or stream.
</p>
<p>
A number of different rule types are given in the
<a href="grades+rules.php">Grades and Rules</a> page.
More details on the precise output format for rules will be
available in the <a href="examples.php">Examples</a> page.
All of the rules stored in the dastabase are given in
the <a href="grades+rules.php">Grades and Rules</a> page.
</p>
<p>
The important tables involved in defining rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>rules(id,name,type,min_req,max_req,ao_group,description)</tt> <br>
where the most important fields are
<ul>
<li> <tt>type</tt> ... one of the types described in the <a href="grades+rules.php">Grades and Rules</a> page
<li> <tt>min_req</tt> ... min requirement to satisfy this rule (could be UOC or a count)
<li> <tt>max_req</tt> ... max requirement for this rule (could be UOC or a count)
<li> <tt>ao_group</tt> ... academic object group associated with the rule
</ul>
<li> <tt>acad_object_groups(id, name, gtype, glogic, gdefby, negated, parent, definition)</tt> <br>
where the most important fields are:
<ul>
<li> <tt>gtype</tt> ... what kind of objects in the group (all objects are the same type, either subjects or streams)
<li> <tt>gdefby</tt> ... how the group is defined (by a list of codes and/or patterns)
<li> <tt>definition</tt> ... where course/stream codes and/or patterns are given
</ul>
<li> <tt>program_rules(program,rule)</tt> associates a rule to a program
<li> <tt>stream_rules(stream,rule)</tt> associates a rule to a stream
</ul>

<h3>Q3 <span class='marks'>(8 marks)</span></h3>

<p>
Write a Python script to show a student's progression through their
program/stream, and what they still need to do to complete their
degree.
The script takes three command line parameters:
</p>
<pre>
./prog  <i>StudentID</i>  [ <i>ProgramCode</i>  <i>StreamCode</i> ]
</pre>
<p>
If no program/stream is given, use the program/stream for the
student's most recent enrolment term.
The script already checks the validity of the command-line arguments.
</p>
<p>
The output should look like a transcript, but with additional
information to indicate which rule each course satisfies
</p>
<pre>
CourseCode  Term  CourseTitle  Mark  Grade  UOC  NameOfRule
</pre>
<p>
The order should be the same as for the transcript script
(i.e. order by term, then by course code within the term).
<p>
You should keep track of which courses and how many UOC
in which rules have been completed.
After the line for each of the courses taken, you should
display a sequence of lines indicating which core
course have not been completed, and how many UOC from
each group of electives remains to be done.
</p>
<p class="brown">
The strategy for ordering the "to be completed" info
</p>
<ul class="brown">
<li> do all CC rules first, stream CC's before program CC's
<li> then do all PE rules, stream PE's before programPE's
<li> then do GE rules, then FE rules
</ul>
<p class="brown">
In other words, most specific to least specific.
</p>
<p class="brown">
Within groups (e.g stream CC's) order by <tt>Rules.id</tt>.
For CC rules, simply print a list of courses, in the order
they appear in the group definition.
For all other rule types, print remaining UOC and the name of
the group.
If a student has completed all UOCs for a rule, then no
information on this rule needs to be printed.
</p>
<p class="red">
If a student has satisfied all rules and enough UOC for the
program, you should print
</p>
<pre class="red">
Eligible to graduate
</pre>
<p class="red">
instead of the "to be completed" text.
</p>
<p>
More details on the precise output format for rules will be
available in the <a href="examples.php">Examples</a> page.
</p>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>
Submit this assignment by doing the following:
</p>
<p style='text-align:center'>
Login to Course Web Site &gt; Assignments &gt;
Assignment 2 &gt; Submit Your Work &gt; Make Submission &gt; <br/>
upload <tt>helpers.sql</tt>, <tt>helpers.py</tt>, <tt>trans</tt>,
<tt>rules</tt>, <tt>prog</tt> &gt; [Submit]
</p>
<p>
The <tt>helpers.sql</tt> file should contain all the views and functions
that you've written to make your Python code simpler.
It should be completely
self-contained and able to load in a single pass, so that it
can be auto-tested as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> a fresh copy of the MyMyUNSW database will be created
	(using the schema from <tt>mymyunsw.dump</tt>)
<li> the data in this database may be <b>different</b> to the
	database that you're using for testing
<li> a new <tt>check.sql</tt> file will be loaded
	(with expected results appropriate for the database)
<li> the contents of your <tt>helpers.sql</tt> file will be loaded
<li> each checking function will be executed and the results recorded
</ul>
<p>
Before you submit your solution, you should check that it will load
correctly for testing by using something like the following operations:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>dropdb mymyunsw</b>                  <span class="comment">... remove any existing DB</span>
$ <b>createdb mymyunsw</b>                <span class="comment">... create an empty database</span>
$ <b>psql mymyunsw -f ..../mymyunsw.dump</b>    <span class="comment">... load the MyMyUNSW schema and data</span>
$ <b>psql mymyunsw -f helpers.sql</b>        <span class="comment">... load your SQL code</span>
</pre>
<p>
Note: if your database contains any views or functions that are not
available in the <tt>helpers.sql</tt> file, you should add them to that
file before you drop the database.
</p>
<p>
If your code does not load without errors, fix it and repeat the above
until it does.
<p>
You must ensure that your <tt>helpers.sql</tt> file will load correctly
(i.e., it has no syntax errors and it contains all of your view definitions
in the correct order).
If we need to manually fix problems with your <tt>helpers.sql</tt>
file in order to test it (e.g., change the order of some definitions),
<b>you will be <q>fined</q> via a 1 mark penalty on
your ceiling mark</b>
(i.e., the maximum you can score is 19 out of 20 marks).
