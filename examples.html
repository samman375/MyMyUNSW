<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This document contains examples of output from the various scripts
that you are required to develop.
</p>

<br/><br/>
<h3>Transcripts</h3>
<p>
You are not required to display e.g. <tt>2778/36</tt>.
This is just to show <nobr>WAM = weighted_mark_sum / total_attempted_uoc</nobr> to help with debugging.

... MORE TO COME ...

</pre>
<br/>
<p>But here's more info  ...<br/>
there are two UOC totals in this question
</p>
<ul>
<li> total_achieved_uoc = sum ( uoc_i) where course_i is a "pass" <br/>
this includes obvious ones like HD,DN,... but also ones like XE <br/>
basically any couse with "yes" in the UOC column in the Grades table </li>
<li> total_attempted_uoc = sum(uoc_i) for any course_i attempted <br>
even if the course was failed, we count its UOC; it was attempted<br/>
any course which has "yes" in the WAM column in the Grades table</li>
<li> weighted_mark_sum = sum(uoc_i * mark_i) for any course_i attempted<br/>
any course which has "yes" in the WAM column in the Grades table</li>
if the course has no mark, treat the mark as zero </li>
</ul>
<p>
WAM = weighted_mark_sum / total_attempted_uoc
